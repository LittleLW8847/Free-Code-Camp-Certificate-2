                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Setting</strong> - The Witch From Mercury happens in "Ad Stella" or A.S. for short while it has all the usual gundam stuff with human live in space colony, the main conflict isn't Earth vs Space like the usual Gundam series, but it is more on a corporate politics ties with revenge story. it really different and would do a good job attracting new fans 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Story</strong> - this is the supposed revenge story, after what happened in episode 0/prolouge(and the additional short novel "Cradel Planet"), Suletta Mercury is unknowingly put into the revenge plan of her mother, by sent to highschool. i know it sounds so weird, but trust me there is a lot of dark undertone and a lot of good foreshadow, but it does have issues. a lot of issue. i understand what they trying to convey here, but the execution is just uh.... 
                    </li>                   
                    <li>
                        <strong>Character</strong> - i like a lot of character in this Anime, ESPECIALLY Guel. weirdly enough his character arc/development is by far the best character arc in the show, yes i'd dare say it is way better than Suletta and Miorine's character development. which is wierd. why? because Suletta and Miorine are the main character. with Guel character arc i wouldn't be surprised if the first ever draft of this show has him as a protagonist before Bandai say "hey maybe we need Yuri in the anime, you know to attract them new fans" then they add Suletta and Miorine as a main character.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mecha Design</strong> - this probabably has the most varied design MS in all of Main Line Gundam. with 4 mecha designer design for each major company with the story. which make the world building and setting way more unique. Peil with Armored Core aesthetic, Hanetaka Ebikawa who design a tons of sleak, furturistic mecha like Gundam Exia line, Arm Slave unit in Full Metal Panic. Ippei Gyobu with his chonky proportion mech and JNHT(iirc i can't rememher this name) give the most organic life like design for the mecha. and every one of the MS in the show is so cool. please bandai, release HG Desultor that this is so cool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pacing</strong> - it is horrible. no, seriously it is horrible. the writer and director add a lot of stuff to pay off into some grand scheme, but only to end everything in the most disatisfying way of "oh yeah, Space Magic makes everything okay every one is friend now". it has potential it really do, with all the corporate politic, the naive and ideal protagonist this is the perfect setup for the slow burn with grand payoff at the end of series. and then they messed up. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Overall</strong> - it's not a bad anime it just, eh it doesn't end in a high note even thought they try to present that way. i don't mind happy ending where everything is well and good, but to do that the writer and director must earned that by resolve everything they had been laid out, forshadow before reach that conclusion.
